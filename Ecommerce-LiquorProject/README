To make sure that the tests work fully you are going to have to make a main method in the testing class.
Make sure that it has QCoreApplication in it so that everything works ok.
Otherwise just a normal main method for google testing is alright.
You will need an empty database for the tests to work and you need to run the tests twice so that all of them work.

Otherwise just run main.cpp to start up the ui.
Register you own user and play around with the features. I reccomend a database viewer for swlLite as that is the database I use.
The database viewer helps confirms the changes to the database.
